# Dataset
1、“227”：
  
The folder named "227" contains optical remote sensing images. 
There are sample images in the folder.
Due to the large size of the image files, 
you can contact us to obtain them or access them through the publicly available dataset below.

2、“aspect”：

The folder named aspect holds the aspect direction data corresponding to landslide and non-landslide images,
which are available from DEM data processing. 
Download the zip file named aspect from the repository and unzip it to use it directly.

3、“slope”：

The folder named slope holds the slope direction data corresponding to landslide and non-landslide images,
which are available from DEM data processing. 
Download the zip file named slope from the repository and unzip it to use it directly.
